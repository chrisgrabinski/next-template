# Button

An interactive element which performs an action on click.

## Example

<Canvas />

## API reference

<Controls />

## Usage

### Default

```tsx
import { Button, type ButtonProps } from "@remote-com/norma/primitives/button";

interface MyCustomButtonProps extends ButtonProps {
  completed?: boolean;
}

const MyCustomButton = ({ children, completed, ...props }: Button) => {
  return (
    <Button {...props}>
      {children}
      {completed ? "✔︎" : ""}
    </Button>
  );
};
```

### As child components

In some cases, you might want to use the provided logic of the button primitive but render a different element. To achieve this, you can use the `asChild` prop.

```tsx
import { Button, type ButtonProps } from "@remote-com/norma/primitives/button";
import Link, { type LinkProps } from "next/link";
import { type ComponentProps } from "react";

interface MyLinkButtonProps
  extends Pick<ButtonProps, "children", "disabled" | "loading">,
    LinkProps {}

const MyLinkButton = ({
  children,
  disabled,
  loading,
  ...linkProps
}: MyLinkButtonProps) => {
  return (
    <Button asChild disabled={disabled} loading={loading}>
      <Link {...linkProps}>{children}</Link>
    </Button>
  );
};
```

## Considerations

### Disabled state

By default, buttons cannot receive focus when disabled, making them undiscoverable for some users (i.e. when using a screen reader or navigating the page with a keyboard). To make the full context available to everyone, we have decided to indicate non-interactivity via the `aria-disabled` prop. To make sure buttons remain non-interactive, we are preventing the `onClick` handler from being fired when disabled.

### Loading state

To make working with loading states easier, the button primitive accepts a `loading` prop. When set, we add an `aria-busy` attribute to the button and prevent the `onClick` handler from being fired.
